SIMPLE ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION
concept---from A to Z we just increment or decrement the position for encoding and decoding respectivly.like for 'A' we decode it as 'C' with incrementing its position by 2.
	--for example -if formula used is i+2 than 'hello' is encoded as 'jgnnq'

What we do is make the user input a message
That message contains-
			1.upper case or lower case keywords(like 'hello' or 'HELLO')
			2.all the symbols (!,@,#..)
			3.spaces between words in the input message('hello world')
			
step1-we make the input message lower case as python is case senstive language "a" and "A" are diffrent
step2-we tokenize the message and store them in list
step3-encrption-
		we first make  four group that contain diffrent charaters-
									-1st group contains !@#$...(in my code it is space)
									-three groups contains a to z alphabtes(in my code it is alpha 1, alpha2, alpha 3)
		now we start a loop of range of length of tokenised message
									-this loop will find current character in alpha 1/alpha 2/alpha 3/space
									-and correspondingly encode that characcter according to the formula aplied
									-all the space character are first appended to a list key and then encoded as '?' so that while decoding key list is used to generate correct character
									-return tokenised encoded message and key
		now the encoded message genrated is concatenated and we get encoded messgae

step 4-decryption-
		loop is started of range length of encoded message-
								-decoded according to formula(these formula are generally opposite to encoding ..in encoding if it is i+1 than in decoding it is i-1)   
								-key is used to decode all the '?' correspondigly
								-return tokenised decoded message
		now tokenised decoded message is conatenated
